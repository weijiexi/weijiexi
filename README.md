### Hi there ðŸ˜„

Iâ€™m a visual and UI/UX designer integrating art, brand identity, and AI-driven intelligent systems.

With over a decade of experience in graphic design and art, Iâ€™m transitioning from traditional mediums to digital and intelligent media designâ€”translating artistic sensibility into interactive, human-centered experiences. My work bridges art, design, and technology, exploring how AI can augment creativity and human expression.

I create experiences that make complex ideasâ€”emotional, cultural, or technicalâ€”intuitive, meaningful, and visually resonant.

- Core tools: HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, React.js, GitHub, Figma, Adobe Suite
- Languages: English | Mandarin

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring AI-driven visual systems and intelligent UX workflows.
