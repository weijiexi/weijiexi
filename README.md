### Hi there 😄

I’m a visual and UI/UX designer integrating art, brand identity, and AI-driven intelligent systems.

I’m transitioning from traditional mediums to digital and intelligent media design—translating artistic sensibility into interactive, human-centered experiences. My work bridges art, design, and technology, exploring how AI can augment creativity and human expression.

I create experiences that make complex ideas—emotional, cultural, or technical—intuitive, meaningful, and visually resonant.

- Core tools: HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, React.js, GitHub, Adobe Suite(PS,AI,AE), Figma, Lottie, Framer
- Languages: English | Mandarin

🌱 Currently exploring AI-driven visual systems and intelligent UX workflows.
