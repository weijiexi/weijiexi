### Hi there ðŸ˜„

I'm Weijie Xi, a visual and UI/UX designer who integrates art, brand identity, and AI-driven intelligent systems.

After spending over a decade overseas in graphic design and art, Iâ€™m transitioning from traditional mediums to digital and intelligent media designâ€”translating artistic sensibility into interactive, human-centered experiences. My work bridges art, design, and technology, exploring how AI can augment creativity and human expression. Iâ€™m passionate about creating experiences that make complex ideasâ€”emotional, cultural, or technicalâ€”more intuitive, meaningful, and visually resonant. 

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, VS Code
- Software: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom Classic, After Effects, Figma
- Language: English, Mandarin

ðŸŒ± currently exploring my AI-driven work.
