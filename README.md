## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Weijie Xi, a UI/UX designer and developer.

After spending over a decade overseas in graphic design and painting, I am transitioning from handmade mediums to digital design. My long-term goal has been to become a UI/UX designer and digital artist. I decided to go back to school to explore digital media design and art since my newly granted green card.
